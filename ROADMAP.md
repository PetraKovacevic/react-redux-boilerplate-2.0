# Roadmap

## Next

* Get the JWT authentication back in and working. Or at least as a plugin-able module

## Future

* Create a sub boilerplate that doesn't have all the extra login stuff. Sometimes it's handy to just have some basic pages without having to remove all of the authentication stuff. Maybe just leave Router and Redux
